#template pattern design sample
php sample of my understanding about template design pattern

by using this design pattern 


## Usage
this design pattern let the subclass set the detail of the process. 
then the base class call a function to process all template subclass provide.

## File

KidMeal.php contain a subclass extends from Meal package 
PrpomotionMeal.php contain another subclass extends from MEal Package

meal_call : php call the template design pattern
