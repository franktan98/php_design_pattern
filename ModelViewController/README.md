#MVC pattern design sample
sample my understanding of MVC design pattern 

by using this design pattern 
Controller will manage data provide by model , and output to selected format
Model will done all data collection, data calculation and many. act as data provider 
View with this sample is HTML output , in actual case we can replace it with others template so it can output as PDF, csv file format, or any kind of formated output.

## Usage
by seperate data-display-and controller will make the code is more easy to understanding and 
usefull for maintainance of large project.
